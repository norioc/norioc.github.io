The reason I wanted to learn more about software engineering all began when I coded my first html website as an elective I took during my last semester in college. It was a web design basic class and to be honest I needed another elective credit to graduate.  After learning the basics of html and css I was able to code a site with entire creative freedom and place whatever i want in what ever style in whatever place I wanted it to be. It felt good to able to do all that with just my laptop and not having to paint or draw, none of those physical work and yet, the website is accessable on every computer in the world. It felt good to be able to express myself in a medium that is commonly used in the world without physical boundaries. Having to graduate from intergrated design, my practice is quite diverse with 2 years of interior design experience and migrated into entrepreneurship, creating a brand identity as my thesis. I wanted to learn more about what coding can inspire me and therefore enquired my friend who works in this field of what course would best fit me and he recommended me to flatiron school. This course would be beneficial for me since I also applied for Design & Tech MFA at parsons and the bootcamp they have is only 15 days long. I wish to be more prepared for the degree I'm pursuing and enrich my ability in design later on.
